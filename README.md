**TwitterTags** is a webservice delveloped in Node.js which aggregates tweets from a specified twitter user into categories/tags which is to be interpreted as a word cloud. This is the unmodified solution to the "Twitter Tags" problem I submitted during a 48hr coding competition at InterviewStreet.com. I am planing on expanding this webservice in to a Node.js module that clouds information from a variety of social media platforms.
